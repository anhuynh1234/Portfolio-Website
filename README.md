# Portfolio-Website
Pieces of HTML, CSS and JavaScript that I developed with tremendous help from freecodecamp's https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-developer-portfolio-website/ 

Still under development as features of a smooth website that scales with mobile phone browsers are still missing and to be added at a later date
